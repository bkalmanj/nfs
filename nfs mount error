## Error when trying to mount nfs share on client system ##

[root@desktop ~]# mount server:/nfs0 /mnt/nfs0c
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on agent:/nfs0,     >> ERROR
       missing codepage or helper program, or other error
       (for several filesystems (e.g. nfs, cifs) you might
       need a /sbin/mount.<type> helper program)

       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail or so.

## When you get the above error, please install nfs-utils on client system as well ##
[root@desktop ~]# yum install nfs-utils

## Then mount the nfs share ##
[root@desktop ~]# mount server:/nfs0 /mnt/nfs0c

## Nfs share has been mounted successfully ##
[root@desktop ~]# ls -ld /mnt/nfs0c/
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 6 Jul  2 10:06 /mnt/nfs0c/
